## To-Do:
1. Add a loading bar with time estimate
2. Add an indicator for URLs that have default sites/this domain is already registered pages
3. Add an actual visual and interactive map wtih tkinter or similar
4. (optional) Make it save the last number generated by each processes in a file on KeyboardInterrupt/exit so that it can resume where it left off.
