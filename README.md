## A way to map the subdomains used by scammers

## To-Do:
1. Make a function that takes in an arbitrary scammer link, sets parameters based on number of integers/URL format
    - find and remove blocks of integers, replace with special token
2. Make a CLI that lets a user enter a scam URL and automatically start mapping their subdomains
